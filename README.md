Knowlodges in Java 8+, ReactJS, SQL, JPA, Typescript, HTML/CSS/JS.

I am a web developer and I started programming in 2014 when I joined the technical high school course of Information System at Cotuca, since then, I have got a few years of experience working with Java EE and now with ReactJS plus Typescript.

Time Experience with Java, JPA, SQL, HTML/CSS/JS (2,5 years) and with ReactJS, Typescript (1 year)

In 2017 I worked for 2 years and 7 months at the company MS+ with Java EE, HTML/CSS, Javascript and SQL. After that, in 2020, I joined the Electrical Engineering course at Unicamp here in Campinas-SP, Brazil. Finally, for the past seven months I have been working as a tech leader in a scientific initiation scholarship, using the ReactJS, Typescript, Node.JS technologies and much more.

I am constantly studying new things to improve my programming knowledges, for example, languages such as Java, Javascript and Typescript, also frameworks such as ReactJS and fundamental concepts about Object Oriented Programming, Functional Programming and Clean Code. Soon, I intend to study more about the topics: Devops and Microsservices.
